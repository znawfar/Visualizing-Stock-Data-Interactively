# Visualizing_Stock_Data_Interactively
----------------------------------------------------------------
> This repo is addressed my answers for the course called Python Project for Data Science by IBM Skills Network.<br>
To extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources, this lab has been created. After collecting this data, low-level and advance visualization are addressed by making interactive charts and different chart types. The stocks I will work with are Tesla.<br>
In the second notebook (USStockLab), I am going to extract the profit data for Tesla and GameStop and compare the price of the stock vs the profit for the hedge fund. Thus, I will use Pandas and yfinance (yahoo finance) libraries.
